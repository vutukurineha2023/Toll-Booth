# Toll-Booth
This project simulates a toll booth using a queue in C++ with a colorful Win32 GUI. Vehicles enter with number and type, are processed in FIFO order, and toll charges update total revenue. The GUI displays the live queue, processed vehicles, and earnings, making the system interactive and easy to understand.
